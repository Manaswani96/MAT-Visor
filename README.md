# 🧠 Mat-Visor: Quantum & Signal Visualization Toolkit

**Mat-Visor** is a MATLAB-powered visualizer for beautiful, math-rich simulations in quantum mechanics and signal processing. From evolving wavefunctions to frequency animations, this project transforms equations into art.

> "For those who see code in color, and physics in poetry."

## 🌌 Features

- 📈 **Gaussian Wavepacket Simulator**  
  Visualizes the free evolution of a quantum particle in 1D space using wavefunction propagation.

- 🎵 **(Coming Soon) FFT Animator**  
  Converts real signals into animated frequency domain plots, showing spectral changes over time.

- 🔥 Aesthetic, Annotated, and Educational  
  Every script is built with simplicity and visuals in mind — ideal for learning or sharing.
