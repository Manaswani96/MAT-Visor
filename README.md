## 📁 Contents

### 1. `fft_animator.m`  
**Purpose**: Visualizes how a signal transforms between time and frequency domains using **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**.  
-  Shows frequency content changes dynamically.
-  Useful in quantum signal processing and filtering concepts.

### 2. `wavepacket_2d_animator.m`  
**Purpose**: Simulates a **2D Gaussian wavepacket** moving in space.  
- 📈 Demonstrates spatial spreading and motion of a quantum particle.
-  Visually rich and interactive surface plots.

### 3. `tunneling_animator.m`  
**Purpose**: Animates **quantum tunneling**, where a particle-like wavepacket interacts with a potential barrier.  
-  Demonstrates partial reflection and transmission.
-  Classic quantum effect that defies classical intuition.

## 🧠 Uses

- **quantum mechanics** 
- Visual content for research blogs, presentations, and outreach
- Concept reinforcement for **wavefunction dynamics**, **uncertainty**, and **signal processing**
