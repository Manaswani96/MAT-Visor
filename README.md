## 📁 Contents

### 1. `fft_animator.m`  
**Purpose**: Visualizes how a signal transforms between time and frequency domains using **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**.  
- 💡 Shows frequency content change dynamically.
- 🔍 Useful in quantum signal processing and filtering concepts.

### 2. `wavepacket_2d_animator.m`  
**Purpose**: Simulates a **2D Gaussian wavepacket** moving in space.  
- 📈 Demonstrates spatial spreading and motion of a quantum particle.
- 🎨 Visually rich and interactive surface plots.

### 3. `tunneling_animator.m`  
**Purpose**: Animates **quantum tunneling**, where a particle-like wavepacket interacts with a potential barrier.  
- 🚀 Demonstrates partial reflection and transmission.
- ⚛️ Classic quantum effect that defies classical intuition.
